<h1>hi</h1>

Congratulations! You've made it ... Happy Valentine's Day! <br><br>

We aren't really doing anything special, so I figured we (or I) could plan something that's more than just what we do usually. So this is me formally inviting you in the most difficult way possible! <br><br>

Let me know what you think - I'd like to plan something special for us.<br><br>

Take the survey:
