Congratulations! You've made it ... Happy Valentine's Day!

We aren't really doing anything special, so I figured we (or I) could plan something that's more than just what we do usually. So this is me formally inviting you in the most difficult way possible! 

Let me know what you think - I'd like to plan something special for us.

Take the survey below:
